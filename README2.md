# Responsive Portfolio
* I use to bootstrap to implement the navs, forms, footer
* Used google fonts for headers 
* I floated the image to the left on the index page in order have the text wrap about it
   * This is only use of custom media queries. Necessary for responsive image
* I used a 200x200 placeholder image for the About Me page
* I used CSS to manipulate Bootstrap elements
* Wrapped all content in "wrappers"
